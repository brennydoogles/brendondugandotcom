# Source code for www.brendondugan.com

## Why is this public?
There are many reasons I am choosing to publish the code for my site, but below are a few of the most compelling:
### Open Source Keeps Me Thinking About Quality
When anyone on the internet can view not only my current site code but also every commit I've made while trying to get 
there, it forces me to think about the best way to accomplish my goal rather than the fastest way. Open Source software 
gives my personal project the benefit that code peer-review gives my professional projects.
### Open Source Lets Me Help Others By Default
By publishing my source code on Github, I am making it easier for people who are learning any of the technologies I've 
used to see that same technology in action. Sometimes the best learning comes not from reading documentation, but from 
reading code that is working in production.
### I'd Be Honored If Someone Adapted My Code For Their Own Website
While there are tons of tools out there that facilitate setting up a good looking website with standard features, once
anyone who needs more flexibility than those tools provide will have a steep learning curve. By providing a pre-built 
framework I hope to simplify that somewhat for others.
